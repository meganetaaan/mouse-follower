- ðŸŽ¯ Smooth physics-based following animation
- ðŸŽ¨ Canvas-based sprite rendering with transparency support
- ðŸ”— Chain multiple followers in formation
- âš¡ High-performance animation with requestAnimationFrame
- ðŸŽ® Customizable physics parameters
- ðŸ“± Works on both desktop and mobile devices

[View package README â†’](./packages/mouse-follower/README.md)

### [Demo Application](./packages/demo)

An interactive demo application showcasing the library's capabilities.

- Multiple follower examples
- Formation demonstrations
- Event-driven animations
- Stack-chan sprite integration

## Development

This project uses pnpm workspace for package management.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm 8+

### Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies for all packages
pnpm install

# Start development servers (library watch + demo dev)
# This runs both TypeScript watch for the library and Vite dev server for the demo in parallel
pnpm dev

# Run tests for the library
pnpm test

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Build library only
pnpm build:lib

# Build demo only
pnpm build:demo

# Lint and format all packages
pnpm check:fix
```

### Development Workflow

#### Starting Development

```bash
# From root directory - starts both library (TypeScript watch) and demo (Vite) in parallel
pnpm dev

# The library will automatically rebuild on changes
# The demo will hot-reload with the latest library changes
```

#### Working on the Library

```bash
cd packages/mouse-follower
pnpm dev           # Run TypeScript in watch mode
pnpm test          # Run tests once
pnpm build         # Build the library for production
```

#### Working on the Demo Only

```bash
cd packages/demo
pnpm dev           # Start Vite dev server (requires library to be built)
```

#### Publishing

The library package is published to npm. To publish a new version:

```bash
# Build and test
pnpm build:lib
pnpm test

# Publish (from root)
pnpm publish:lib
```

### Testing

The library uses Vitest with jsdom for testing:

- Unit tests for physics calculations
- DOM manipulation tests
- Animation system tests
- Sprite rendering tests

Run tests with:

```bash
pnpm test              # Run once
pnpm test --watch      # Watch mode
pnpm test --coverage   # Coverage report
```
